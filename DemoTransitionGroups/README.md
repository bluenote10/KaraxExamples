## Transitions Groups

Small example of how to implement transition groups in Karax.

![Demo](../.gifs/demo_transitiongroups.gif?raw=true "Demo")

Currently requires a modified version of Karax, see my PR's for Karax.

Inspired by:

* Paul Lewis's [FLIP transitions](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/)
* Vue's [list move transitions](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#List-Move-Transitions)
